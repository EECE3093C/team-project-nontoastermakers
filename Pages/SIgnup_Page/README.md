# Registration Page

The Registration page is how a user can sign-up for an account for Campus Dash.  Once the user enters the page, they must enter their M Number, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Password.  After the user clicks the Submit button, the backend transfers to the database.  The information waits until an Admin approves the account, at which point the user can sign in the account.
